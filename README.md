# CoffeeMakerUnitTests


From the Program already created, I had to test it's proper functionality by creating JUnit tests.

This Folder can be tricky to navigate to get to my tests, but the path is:

CoffeeMaker-Unit-Tests/Coffee Maker Unit Tests/Assign/CoffeeMaker_JUnit_Assign/build/classes/java/test/edu/ncsu/csc326/coffeemaker/

In there, you'll find the Java file containing my JUnit tests.

This assignment was a part of the NCSU course that was offered on Coursera. The program itself (the CoffeeMaker), was created and coded by them. I simply created JUnit tests for the program.
